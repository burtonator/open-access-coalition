<b>Greg Kidd</b> is the founder of <a href="http://3taps.com">3taps</a> -- which battles for open access for publicly listed exchange postings from popular classified sites like Craigslist, eBay and Backpage. He's also an adviser at the payments startup Square, and an initial investor in Twitter. In his prior life he worked for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and took public Dispatch Management Services Corp.   Greg is the backer of Hard Yaka, which funds innovators in the UGC posting, search, messaging and payments space.

<q><a href="http://3taps.com">3taps</a> believe public facts like offers of goods and service for exchange, are public property that are openly and equally available to everyone.  3taps further believes that a "data commons" of public information is the most efficient way for developers to create offerings that cut across all sources of user generated content.  Fair access to public data is a matter of good intellectual property policy, a innovative and competitive marketplace, and a foundation for free speech.</p>
