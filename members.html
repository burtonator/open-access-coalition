<q><a href="http://3taps.com">3taps</a> believe public facts like offers of goods and service for exchange, are public property that are openly and equally available to everyone.  3taps further believes that a "data commons" of public information is the most efficient way for developers to create offerings that cut across all sources of user generated content.  Fair access to public data is a matter of good intellectual property policy, a innovative and competitive marketplace, and a foundation for free speech.</q>

<q>Fair access to real estate listing and transaction information is critical to the real estate consumer. Without an open web, innovation is stifled and the consumer is punished with higher fees, less transparency and options. When that happens, the entire market suffers because it is less efficient, and weaker as a result.</q>
