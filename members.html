<h2>Founders</h2>

<p>
<b>Kevin Burton</b> is the CEO and founder of <a href="http://spinner.com">Spinn3r</a> a weblog and social media crawler.  He's also the founder and CEO of <a href="http://statmover.com">StatMover</a> a distributed time series database company.  In a former life he was one of the inventors of RSS 1.0 and has been working in the crawling, search, and aggregation industry for 15 years.  He sold his first company at 25 and his second company, Rojo to Six Apart at 30.  He was also a contributor to the Apache Software Foundation and helped create Apache Ant, invented the XML format used by Gump and Maven, and also contributed to Tomcat and Jakarta.  He also works on a Bigtable and Map Reduce implementation named <a href="http://peregrine_mapreduce.bitbucket.org">Peregrine</a> which is 10-50x faster than Hadoop for iterative computations.  In his spare time he's an avid backpacker and has hiked most of Yosemite and Yellowstone.</p>

<p>
<b>Greg Kidd</b> is the founder of <a href="http://3taps.com">3taps</a> -- which battles for open access for publicly listed exchange postings from popular classified sites like Craigslist, eBay and Backpage.  He's also an adviser at the payments startup Square, and an initial investor in Twitter.  In his prior life he worked for the Fed in DC, and took public DMSC -- the world wide network of messenger firms that Jack Dorsey hacked into back when that was a feat of accomplishment that got you hired rather than a ticket to a federal prosecution under the CFAA.  Greg also has backed Hard Yaka, which funds a number of innovators in the onboarding, search, messaging and payments space -- some of which have been threatened or sued by Craigslist on trumped up IP claims and interoperation bans that personify the types of unfair access practices that the OAC seeks to redress.
