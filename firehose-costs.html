<h1>Firehose Costs</h1>

<p> A firehose API provides a raw stream of updates to content published in (near) real time.  This stream of content can be faster and cheaper for websites like <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://status.net">Status.net</a> to serve (vs having a crawler index the content).</p>

<p>One criticism that websites often make is that hosting raw and realtime access to their content would be prohibitively expensive.  As we whill show, this is simply not the case.</p>

<h2>Microblogging</h2>

<p>At the time of this writing, Twitter is indexing about 300M tweets per day.  If we were to break this down into the costs to serve this API we would have:</p>

<table width="500">
<tr><td><b>posts per day: </b></td>                                  <td>300M</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>bytes per month<sup>1</sup>: </b></td>     <td>1.2TB</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>price per month (bytes per month * $0.15 (Amazon EC2 pricing)): </b></td>     <td>$189</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<small>
    1. 150 bytes for the max post length multipled by number of posts per day multipled by 30 days in a month.
