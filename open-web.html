<h1>Our goal is to fight for the open web!</h1>

<h2>What is the open web?</h2>

<p>The open web is based on the concept that websites participate fairly with
   one another and allow data to be published and accessed without being
   blocked by a walled garden which otherwise prevents access to the data.
</p>

<p>
  A real world example is the way Google fetches content from websites on the
  Internet and was able to build a billion dollar industry on data posted on the public Internet.
</p>

<p>Much of this content is published within the public domain, available under
  fair use, or Creative Commons license.
  </p>

<p>Problems arise when this data is subsequently blocked from being
 accessed by 3rd parties <b>even</b> when the 3rd party has a license for the
 data.
