<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is non-discriminatory access?</h3>

<p>
A major component to a fair access policy is non-discriminatory access.  It's
paramount that a hosting provider treat each party in a similar manner.  The
access rules must remain consistent.
</p>

<p>
We have seen this applied in the past where a hosting provider will cut off API
access to a company should they decide that they are making too much revenue or
that their product is now competing with something they want to offer.
</p>

<p>
This is a chilling effect becuase it prevents companies from investing
significantly in an API because they may be cut off at any time.
