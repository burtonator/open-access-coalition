<h1>Our goal is to fight for the open web!</h1>

<a name="open-web"/>

<h2>What is the open web?</h2>

<p>The open web is based on the concept that websites participate fairly with
   one another and allow data to be published and accessed without being
   blocked by a walled garden which otherwise prevents access to the data.
</p>

<p>
  A real world example is the way Google fetches content from websites on the
  Internet and was able to build a billion dollar industry on data posted
  publicly.
</p>

<p>Much of this data is published within the public domain, available under
  fair use, or Creative Commons license.
  </p>

<p>Problems arise when this data is subsequently blocked from being
 accessed by 3rd parties <b>even</b> when the 3rd party has a license for the
 data.
</p>

<h2>What is non-discriminatory access?</h2>

<a name="non-discriminatory"/>
<p>
A major component to a fair access policy is non-discriminatory access.  It's
paramount that a hosting provider treat each party in an identical manner.  The
access rules must remain consistent.
</p>

<p>
We have seen this applied in the past where a hosting provider will cut off API
access to a company should they decide that they are making too much revenue or
that their product is now competing with something they want to offer.
</p>

<p>
This is a chilling effect because it prevents companies from investing
significantly in an API because they may be cut off at any time.
</p>

<p>This is very similar to the way patents are licensed within open standards
using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing">FRAND (Fair Reasonable and Non-discriminatory Licensing)</a>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
Non-discriminatory relates to both the terms and the rates included in licensing
agreements. As the name suggests this commitment requires that licensors treat
each individual licensee in a similar manner. This does not mean that the rates
and payment terms can’t change dependent on the volume and creditworthiness of
the licensee. However it does mean that the underlying licensing condition
included in a licensing agreement must be the same regardless of the licensee.
This obligation is included in order to maintain a level playing field with
respect to existing competitors and to ensure that potential new entrants are
free to enter the market on the same basis.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Without non-discriminatory access, the web is not open.
</p>

<h2>Don't hosting providers have the right to publish content under any terms of use they desire?</h2>

<p>
Absolutely!  A hosting provider is well within their rights to publish
content under any license they like.  This could either be very unfair <i>or</i>
very fair.
</p>

<p>However, users have the right to know about the access policies of
sites they use, similar to privacy policies.
</p>

<p>Further, the OAC and the user community is free to criticize these sites or
take their business elsewhere.
</p>

<p>We believe it's in the users best interest to insist on using sites that
have fair access.  Additionally, we feel it's vital to the growth of the
industry to have a free, fair, and open Internet.
</p>

<h2>What are some common examples that violate fair access?</h2>

<h3>Blocking all crawlers via robots.txt - except Google.</h3>

<p>This happens far too often.  This is a problem for new search
engines because they have to make a decision about whether to yield to
the robots.txt block, contact the website owner (which could involve
thousands of websites) or providing a sub-standard experience to their
users.
</p>

<h3>Differential pricing based on size, or hidden partnerships.</h3>

<p>There have been situations where API licenses are given based on
hidden partnerships, private investments, or size of company which have
prevented open use of the data.</p>

<p>One example is Twitter's firehose license to Google and Microsoft.</p>

<p>Twitter licensed their firehose to Google (for millions of dollars)
and Google eventually didn't like the terms and <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110715/with-google-gone-for-now-twitter-tries-to-come-to-terms-with-microsofts-bing/">cancelled their license</a>.
</p>

<p>The issue seems to be that Twitter was attempting to charge Google
an excessive price for a full license for which Google refused.</p>

<h3>Harassment</h3>

<p>There have also been situations where large social networks have
harassed both individuals and small companies with large lawsuits or
threat of lawsuit simply for accessing data in new and compelling
situations - even when perfectly lawful.</p
