<h1>Our goal is to fight for the open web!</h1>

<a name="open-web"/>
<h2>What is the open web?</h2>

<p>The open web is based on the concept that websites participate fairly with
   one another and allow data to be published and accessed without being
   blocked by a walled garden which otherwise prevents access to the data.
</p>

<p>
  A real world example is the way Google fetches content from websites on the
  Internet and was able to build a billion dollar industry on data posted
  publicly.
</p>

<p>Much of this data is published within the public domain, available under
  fair use, or Creative Commons license.
  </p>

<p>Problems arise when this data is subsequently blocked from being
 accessed by 3rd parties <b>even</b> when the 3rd party has a license for the
 data.
</p>

<h2>What is non-discriminatory access?</h2>

<a name="non-discriminatory"/>
<p>
A major component to a fair access policy is non-discriminatory access.  It's
paramount that a hosting provider treat each party in an identical manner.  The
access rules must remain consistent.
</p>

<p>
We have seen this applied in the past where a hosting provider will cut off API
access to a company should they decide that they are making too much revenue or
that their product is now competing with something they want to offer.
</p>

<p>
This is a chilling effect becuase it prevents companies from investing
significantly in an API because they may be cut off at any time.
</p>

<p>
With out non-discriminatory access, the web is not open.
