<h1>Examples of unfair and exclusionary data sharing practices.</h1>

<p>
Unfortunately there are far too many examples of unfair data sharing
pratices. We're keeping a list of running examples here to help make it clear
that this isn't a theoretical problem.  It's real and happening now and hurting
innovation in the tech industry.

<h2>Facebook Blocks Yandex's New Social Search App From Accessing Its Data Just Three Hours After Launch</h2>

<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/24/facebook-blocks-yandex-wonder/">From Techcrunch:</a>

<p>
<blockquote>
Yandex begged Facebook not to shut down its social search app Wonder that launched this morning. But the explanation Yandexs lawyers sent us for why its compliant with Facebooks policies didnt stop Facebook from blocking all API calls from Wonder, Yandex confirms. Facebook tells me its now discussing policy with Yandex. The move follows a trend of Facebook aggressively protecting its data.

<a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/01/facebook-blockades-yandex/">From Wired:</a>

<p>
<blockquote>
Yandexs new mobile social assistant Wonder was supposed to coalesce a users data from Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and Instagram and use the data to help answer questions asked verbally, sort of like the Siri feature on Apples iPhone. Instead, Yandex is now in a dispute with Facebook, TechCrunch reports, with the two sides at odds over whether Wonder is properly defined as a search engine and thus in violation of rules governing the use of data provided by Facebook through its software interfaces, or APIs. In the meantime, Facebook has cut off Yandexs API access, rendering Wonder significantly less viable. (Facebook could not be reached for comment.)

<h2>Power.com fights for the right to sync to Facebook</h2>

<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/powercom-fights-back-against-facebook/">From NY Times:</a>

<p>
<blockquote>
On Friday, Power.com, a site that lets users sign in to several social networks from one place, plans to respond to the lawsuit that Facebook filed against it with its own suit. It alleges that Facebook is prohibiting its users from accessing their Facebook content through Power.com and that it is trying to monopolize the social networking market.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
Power.coms idea was to create a portal through which people could enter various social networking sites. Right now, people can enter their log-in information for MySpace, Twitter, LinkedIn, Hi5 or Orkut and see their social network updates and contacts from all their networks at once. But some of the social networks are not so happy about Power.com trying to keep users on its site.

<h2>Facebook Threatens to Sue Pete Warden</h2>

He was with the head of their security team, who I knew slightly because I'd reported several security holes to Facebook over the years. The attorney said that they were just about to sue me into oblivion, but in light of my previous good relationship with their security team, they'd give me one chance to stop the process. They asked and received a verbal assurance from me that I wouldn't publish the data, and sent me on a letter to sign confirming that. Their contention was robots.txt had no legal force and they could sue anyone for accessing their site even if they scrupulously obeyed the instructions it contained. The only legal way to access any web site with a crawler was to obtain prior written permission.

<h2>PeopleBrowsr vs. Twitter Legal Battle Returns to San Francisco Court</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/28/peoplebrowsr-vs-twitter/">From Techcrunch:</a>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
PeopleBrowsr, the maker of social analytics tools such as Kred, has won a temporary restraining order against Twitter, allowing the company to maintain full access to Twitter’s firehose of data.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
The victory for PeopleBrowsr is short-term, but it does mean that the company won’t be cut off on November 30, which is what PeopleBrowsr says Twitter was threatening. Temporary restraining orders are usually granted until the court is ready to decide on a preliminary injunction (which would last until the case is decided). The hearing to discuss the injunction is scheduled for January 8.</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
To fight that, PeopleBrowsr took Twitter to state court, alleging anticompetitive actions. Twitter argued that this should be a federal court issue and tried to parlay the fight over to a higher court of opinion. If successful, that could have invalidated PeopleBrowsr’s temporary restraining order — which was filed in a California state court — essentially terminating PeopleBrowsr’s access to Twitter’s fire hose.
