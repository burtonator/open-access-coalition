<h2>Facebook Blocks Yandex’s New Social Search App From Accessing Its Data Just Three Hours After Launch</h2>

<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/24/facebook-blocks-yandex-wonder/">From Techcrunch:</a>

<p>
<blockquote>
Yandex begged Facebook not to shut down its social search app Wonder that launched this morning. But the explanation Yandex’s lawyers sent us for why it’s compliant with Facebook’s policies didn’t stop Facebook from blocking all API calls from Wonder, Yandex confirms. Facebook tells me it’s now discussing policy with Yandex. The move follows a trend of Facebook aggressively protecting its data.

<p>
<blockquote>
Yandex’s new mobile social “assistant” Wonder was supposed to coalesce a user’s data from Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and Instagram and use the data to help answer questions asked verbally, sort of like the Siri feature on Apple’s iPhone. Instead, Yandex is now in a dispute with Facebook, TechCrunch reports, with the two sides at odds over whether Wonder is properly defined as a search engine and thus in violation of rules governing the use of data provided by Facebook through its software interfaces, or APIs. In the meantime, Facebook has cut off Yandex’s API access, rendering Wonder significantly less viable. (Facebook could not be reached for comment.)
