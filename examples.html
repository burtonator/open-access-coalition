<h2>Facebook Blocks Yandex’s New Social Search App From Accessing Its Data Just Three Hours After Launch</h2>

<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/24/facebook-blocks-yandex-wonder/">From Techcrunch:</a>

<p>
<blockquote>
Yandex begged Facebook not to shut down its social search app Wonder that launched this morning. But the explanation Yandex’s lawyers sent us for why it’s compliant with Facebook’s policies didn’t stop Facebook from blocking all API calls from Wonder, Yandex confirms. Facebook tells me it’s now discussing policy with Yandex. The move follows a trend of Facebook aggressively protecting its data.

<p>
<blockquote>
Yandex’s new mobile social “assistant” Wonder was supposed to coalesce a user’s data from Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and Instagram and use the data to help answer questions asked verbally, sort of like the Siri feature on Apple’s iPhone. Instead, Yandex is now in a dispute with Facebook, TechCrunch reports, with the two sides at odds over whether Wonder is properly defined as a search engine and thus in violation of rules governing the use of data provided by Facebook through its software interfaces, or APIs. In the meantime, Facebook has cut off Yandex’s API access, rendering Wonder significantly less viable. (Facebook could not be reached for comment.)

<h2>Power.com fights for the right to sync to Facebook</h2>

<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/powercom-fights-back-against-facebook/">From NY Times:</a>

<p>
<blockquote>
On Friday, Power.com, a site that lets users sign in to several social networks from one place, plans to respond to the lawsuit that Facebook filed against it with its own suit. It alleges that Facebook is prohibiting its users from accessing their Facebook content through Power.com and that it is trying to monopolize the social networking market.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
Power.com’s idea was to create a portal through which people could enter various social networking sites. Right now, people can enter their log-in information for MySpace, Twitter, LinkedIn, Hi5 or Orkut and see their social network updates and contacts from all their networks at once. But some of the social networks are not so happy about Power.com trying to keep users on its site.
