<q><a href="http://3taps.com">3taps</a> believe public facts like offers of goods and service for exchange, are public property that are openly and equally available to everyone.  3taps further believes that a "data commons" of public information is the most efficient way for developers to create offerings that cut across all sources of user generated content.  Fair access to public data is a matter of good intellectual property policy, a innovative and competitive marketplace, and a foundation for free speech.</p>
